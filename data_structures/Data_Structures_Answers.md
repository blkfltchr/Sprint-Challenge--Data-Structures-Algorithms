Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

`O(n)` - linear

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

`O(n)` - linear

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

`O(n)` - linear

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

`O(n)` - linear

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

At least `O(log n)` but I'm not too sure

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

`O(¯\_(ツ)_/¯)`
